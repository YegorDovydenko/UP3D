This is an apple script app to make the printing of G-code files easy.
The app can be started and it asks then for a G-Code file, it supports
drag and drop of G-Code files and it can be integrated with e.g. Slic3r.
Simply download print_up3d.pkg and install it with a double click.
The application is then located in the /Application folder.

When you start printer_up3d.app the first time it will gradually ask
for the executables of ”up3dtranscoder“ and “upload“.

Installing the app in Slic3er

1) copy the launch script print_up3d.sh to place you remember
1) make it executable via Terminal with the command ”chmod +x print_up3d.sh“
2) go to Print Settings / Output options / Post-processing scripts
3) enter the full path of the script e.g. "/Users/myself/Desktop/print_up3d.sh“ 

The app asks for the nozzle height and saves this value for the next time.
It shows you always the last used nozzle height and you can modify it in case you need to.


Notes for building the app and package

Use Apple Script Editor to open the print_up3d.applescipt file.
Export the file as Application and save it.
Move print_up3d.app to the desired location, e.g. /Applications.
Later the install package will use this location for deployment.
In Terminal build the package with the command:

productbuild --component /Applications/print_up3d.app print_up3d.pkg

The print_up3d script uses some defaults in order to save the nozzle height and location of transcoder and uploader.
When you delete those defaults the script will ask again for the location of the executables.
Use the following command to delete all the defaults for the script:

defaults delete com.up3d.transcode

Then launch print_up3d.app again for assigning new values.
